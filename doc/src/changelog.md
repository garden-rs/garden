for omitting groups and gardens from its output.

**Development**:

- The `v2.0.0` release removed `Cargo.lock` and added an entry for it to `.gitignore`.
The `.gitignore` entry has now been removed to make it easier for packagers to track
their changes.

Windows as being officially supported. This development has now been documented
in the installation section of the Garden User Guide.

**Packaging**:

- The Nightly Build artifacts from Gitlab CI have been updated to include `garden-gui`.


## v2.0.0

*Released 2025-01-26*

([#20](https://gitlab.com/garden-rs/garden/-/issues/20))


## v1.10.0

*Released 2024-12-14*

**Features**:

- `garden grow` can now filter the remotes that will be updated by specifying a glob
pattern to the new `--remote` option.

- `garden ls` now has a `-s | --sort` option that allows you to sort
trees by name or modification time.

**Development**:

- Use of the [unmaintained](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0388)
`derivative` crate has been eliminated.


## v1.9.1

*Released 2024-11-06*

**Features**:

- `GARDEN_CMD_VERBOSE` and `GARDEN_CMD_QUIET` are now updated when using
`garden <command> -v ...` and `garden cmd <command> -v ...`.
Previously, these variables were only set when `-v` was used against the `garden`
command directly, before any sub-commands, e.g. `garden -v ...`.

**Fixes**:

- `garden exec`'s parallel mode was made more robust.


## v1.9.0

*Released 2024-10-11*

**Features**:

- `garden exec` can now run commands in parallel using the `-j# | --jobs=#` option.
([#43](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/issues/43))

**Packaging**:

- Garden's Nix flake was improved and using Garden with Nix home-manager was documented.
([#46](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/46))
([#17](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/issues/17))

**Development**:

- Internal APIs for running commands were refactored.

- The `yaml-rust2` dependency was upgraded to v0.9.


## v1.8.0

*Released 2024-09-26*

**Features**:

- `garden cmd` and custom commands now have a `-j# | --jobs=#` option for
[running commands in parallel](https://garden-rs.gitlab.io/commands.html#parallel-execution).
Use `-j0 | --jobs=0` to use all available cores.
([#43](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/issues/43))
([#45](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/45))

- `garden ls` now has a `--reverse | -r` option to display trees in reverse order.
([#44](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/44))

**Development**:

- The `which`, `yansi` and `strum` dependencies were upgraded. `yansi` was a new major version
and required a fair amount of changes. `strum` involved minor changes.
([#42](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/42))


## v1.7.0

*Released 2024-06-29*

**Features**:

- `garden ls` now has a `--commands | -c` option to display just commands.
The related `--no-commands | -C` option is used to omit commands from being displayed.
([#39](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/issues/39))
([#41](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/41))

- `garden cmd` and `garden <custom-command>` now support a `--dry-run | -N` option
to perform trial runs without actually running any commands.
([#39](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/issues/39))
([#41](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/41))

- `garden exec` made `-N` the short option for its `--dry-run` option and the original
`-n` short option was made an undocumented alias for compatibility.
([#41](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/41))

- The `garden eval`, `garden exec`, `garden cmd` and custom sub-commands
now accept the same `--define | -D name=value` override options as the root
`garden` command.

- `garden grow` reports more details about the commands it runs and no
longer prints redundant `git config` commands.

**Fixes**:

- `garden ls` now prints the list of commands in the same order as they appear in `garden.yaml`.
([#39](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/issues/39))
([#41](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/41))

**Packaging**:

- The nix flake was updated to re-enable llvm coverage.
([#38](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/38))

- `nix run` can now be used to run `garden` and `nix shell` can now be used to
open a nix shell with garden installed.
([#40](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/40))

**Development**:

- More structs, functions and methods were made private.

- Several types were renamed from "HashMap" to "Map".


## v1.6.0

*Released 2024-06-02*

**Features**:

- `zsh` is now invoked using `zsh +o nomatch` for better portability across
shells. This prevents zsh from erroring when wildcard patterns find
no matches. Wildcards can be used, for example, to implement a
custom `clean` command that feeds `rm -f` using wildcard patterns,
but these commands would generate errors without disabling `nomatch`.
The zsh `nomatch` option is a less useful option for non-interactive use
so we disable it unconditionally.

- The `--verbose | -v` option can now be passed to custom and built-in commands.
The `verbose` option was previously a global option that had to
be specified before sub-commands. The following invocations are all
equivalent now:
  - `garden -vv build`
  - `garden -v build -v`
  - `garden build -vv`

  ([#36](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/36))

**Packaging**:

- The nix flake was updated to use Fenix for the latest stable rustc 1.78.0.
([#37](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/37))

**Development**:

- An `.envrc` file was added to enable the nix flake for direnv users.
([#37](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/37))


## v1.5.0

*Released 2024-04-14*

**Features**:

- Running `garden init` inside a Git repository will now record the
current directory as a tree with its path set to  `${GARDEN_CONFIG_DIR}`.
([#34](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/34))

- Custom commands skip missing trees by default. A new `-f | --force`
option can be used to make `garden` run commands on missing trees.
([#33](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/issues/33))

- `garden plant` now avoids updating the configuration when a tree is
re-planted and its configuration contains expressions that evaluate
to the same value as currently exist in git.
([#31](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/issues/31))
([#32](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/32))

**Packaging**:

- [Prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/releases)
are now available!

**Development**:

- The original github repository under `davvid`'s namespace was transferred to the
[garden-rs](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden) organization on github.

- The `yaml-rust2` dependency was upgraded to `0.8.0` to avoid the `encoding` crate
([RUSTSEC-2021-0153](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0153)).


## v1.4.1

*Released 2024-03-22*

**Features**:

- The empty directory detection in `garden grow` was improved.

**Development**:

- The internal APIs were updated to use `AsRef<Path>` wherever possible.


## v1.4.0

*Released 2024-03-21*

**Features**:

- Custom commands can now specify an interpreter to use on a per-command basis.
If a command uses a shebang `#!` line then the command's text will be passed as the
next argument to the specified command. For example, using `#!python3 -c` as the
first line in a custom command will cause `python3 -c <command>` to be executed.

- Trees can now use branches defined in separate remotes when configuring the
default branch to checkout. `garden grow` will now fetch the remote associated with the
configured branch switching branches in order to make this possible.

- Trees can now use any upstream branch from any configured remote in the `branches` section.
Previously, branches associated with non-default remotes could not be created unless
they were fetched beforehand. `garden grow` will now fetch the associated remote
before creating the local branch.

- `garden grow` now detects empty directories (e.g. the directories that are created
when using uninitialized Git submodules) and will properly clone into the empty directories
instead of treating them like an already-grown tree.
([#30](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/30))

**Development**:

- `garden` can now be built on Windows. Symlink trees and the XDG base directory support
is UNIX-only and disabled on Windows.
([#17](https://gitlab.com/garden-rs/garden/-/issues/17))

- [yaml-rust2](https://crates.io/crates/yaml-rust2) is now used instead of
the [yaml-rust-davvid](https://crates.io/crates/yaml-rust-davvid) fork that was
being maintained by [@davvid](https://github.com/davvid) for use by garden.
([#29](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/29))


## v1.3.0

*Released 2024-02-19*

**Features**:

- `garden eval` and garden expressions in general will now resolve variables defined
within `environment` blocks. Environment blocks were previously not considered when
resolving variables. Environment blocks are now resolved and checked for variables
when `${variable}` expressions do not find the variable in scopes with higher
precedence. The precedence order, from strongest to weakest, is the `variables`
block in a garden's scope, the `variables` block in a tree's scope, the
`variables` block in global configuration scope, the `environments` block in
a garden's scope, the `environments` block in a tree's scope, the
`environments` block in global configuration scope and, lastly, OS environment
variables. The first entry found is used when expanding variable expressions.
([#23](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/23))

- Evaluation cycles (i.e. circular variable dependencies) are now prevented when
evaluating garden variables. The evaluation engine will now return empty strings
when a variable with a cyclical expression is evaluated.
([#24](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/24))

- When `zsh` is used as the `garden.shell`, which happens automatically when `zsh`
is installed, `garden` will now use `zsh -o shwordsplit` in order to enable
word-splitting of `$variable` expressions by default. This makes `zsh` behave
just like other shells by default, which improves the portability of commands.
Configure `garden.shell-wordsplit` to `false` or use the
`garden <cmd> -z | --no-wordsplit` option to opt-out of this behavior.
([#25](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/25))

- `garden.shell` can now be configured to use arbitrary commands for executing
command strings. Garden uses the configured `garden.shell` as-is and does
not augment its options (e.g. `-e`  or `-o shwordsplit`) when a custom command
is used. Custom commands are identified as commands that expand to 2 or more
command-line arguments. Thus, `python3` is not considered a custom command
and `garden` will run `python3 -c <string>` to run commands. On the other
hand, specifying `ruby -e` *is* considered a custom command because it
expands to `["ruby", "-e"]` under the hood. If you need to use a custom
command  that takes no additional command-line arguments then you can
use `env` as an extra argument to have it be considered as a custom shell.
For example, `env custom-shell` will cause `garden` to run
`env custom-shell <string>`, which is equivalent to `custom-shell <string>`.
Using just `custom-shell` would have resulted in `garden` running
`custom-shell -c <string>` instead, which may not be desired.
([#26](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/26))

- The `garden shell` command can now be configured to use an interactive command shell
that is distinct from the command specified in the `garden.shell` configuration by
configuring the `garden.interactive-shell` value.
([#26](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/26))

- `garden shell` can now be run without any arguments. The tree query now defaults to
`.` so that the tree in the current directory is used when nothing is specified.
([#26](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/26))

- Custom commands now have access to a `${GARDEN_CMD_VERBOSE}` and `${GARDEN_CMD_QUIET}`
variables which can be used to forward the `--verbose` and `--quiet` arguments
down into child `garden` invocations. `${GARDEN_CMD_VERBOSE}` uses the short `-v`
flag in the value to support the case where the verbose option is specified
multiples times to increase the verbosity level (e.g. `-vv`).
([#27](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/27))


## v1.2.1

*Released 2024-02-05*

**Development**:

- The `yaml-rust-davvid` dependency was upgraded to `v0.6.0`.

- Documentation and code maintenance.


## v1.2.0

*Released 2024-01-27*

**Features**:

- If a garden file has no trees defined at all then an implicit tree called
`.` will now be synthesized into existence. The presence of this implicit tree
allows garden files that define just the current directory as a tree to omit
the entire `trees` section altogether. This consequently makes it easier
to use garden as a simple command runner because the `commands` section
is the only section required in order to run `garden` commands.

- When `garden.root` is not configured `garden` will behave as if
`garden.root` is configured to `${GARDEN_CONFIG_DIR}`. This allows garden files to
omit `garden.root` from their configuration in typical scenarios.

- Configuring `garden.root` to an empty string (`""`) will behave as if `garden.root`
is configured to the current directory from which `garden` was run.

- When a `garden.yaml` file does not exist in the current directory then garden
will walk up the file system searching for `garden.yaml` or the name specified using
`garden -c <name>`. Garden will behave as if it were launched from the directory
containing the garden file when a configuration file is found.

- The `GARDEN_CEILING_DIRS` and `GIT_CEILING_DIRS` environment variables can be
used to limit the `garden.yaml` discovery by preventing `garden` from traversing
into and beyond the specified directories when discovering garden files.

- `garden exec`, `garden cmd` `garden grow`, `garden ls` and custom garden commands
can now filter the trees they operate over by passing a glob pattern using
`-t | --trees` option. These commands will only operate on the trees whose names
match the pattern. This allows you to specify a garden as the tree query and use
the full set of environment variables from all trees in the query while
executing commands over a subset of the trees in that garden.

- `garden init` will now add the current directory to the `trees` block
when the current directory contains a Git repository. Use `garden init --empty`
to disable this behavior.

**Development**:

- The `shlex` dependency was upgraded to `1.3.0`, which includes fixes for
[RUSTSEC-2024-0006](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0006.html) a.k.a.
[GHSA-r7qv-8r2h-pg27](https://github.com/comex/rust-shlex/security/advisories/GHSA-r7qv-8r2h-pg27).

## v1.1.0

*Released 2024-01-15*

**Features**:

- `garden ls` now displays information about trees, groups, gardens and commands.

- `garden ls -c` (i.e. `--no-commands`) hides command details from the output.

- `garden plant -s` (i.e. `--sort`) sorts all of the configured `trees` entries
after planting the specified trees.

- `garden exec -n` (i.e. `--dry-run`) performs a trial run without executing
any commands.

- `garden.shell-errexit` can now be configured to `false` in `garden.yaml` to
opt-out of using the `-e` exit-on-error shell option when running custom commands.

- `garden.shell` can now be configured to `bun`, `fish`, `node`, `perl` and `python3`
in addition to the traditional `bash`, `zsh`, `dash`, `ksh` and `sh` shells.
This allows you to use these interpreters to run custom commands.

**Development**:

- Garden is now using
[shellexpand v3](https://gitlab.com/ijackson/rust-shellexpand#version-300-2022-12-01).

## v1.0.0

*Released 2023-12-23*

**Features**:

- Commands can now specify pre-commands and post-commands that are run before/after
the specified command.
([#3](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/issues/3))
([documentation](https://garden-rs.gitlab.io/commands.html#pre-and-post-commands))

- The default `origin` remote name can now be configured using `tree.<tree>.default-remote`.
([#16](https://gitlab.com/garden-rs/garden/-/issues/16))

- Commands now display the tree's current branch alongside the tree name.
([#18](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/issues/18))

- `garden -vv exec` and `garden -vv shell` now display the command being run.

**Packaging**:

- `garden` can now be installed as a `nix flake` package.
A `flake.nix` file is now provided.
([#16](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/issues/16))

## v0.9.1

*Released 2023-11-19*

**Fixes**:

- `garden -D name=value` now overrides variables in all scopes.
Variables defined in tree scope were not subject to overrides and
will now get properly overridden by the `--define` / `-D`
command-line options.

## v0.9.0

*Released 2023-11-02*

**Features**:

- `garden grow` now sets `git config remote.$name.tagopt --no-tags`
when adding additional remotes. This prevents accidentally fetching tags
when interacting with remotes.

## v0.8.1

*Released 2023-07-18*

**Fixes**:

- `garden grow` was fixed to detect existing branches when growing
`git worktree`-created child worktrees.

**Development**:

- `strum` is now used to implement `FromStr` for `enum ColorMode`.

- [is-terminal](https://crates.io/crates/is-terminal) is now used instead of
the unmaintained `atty` crate.

## v0.8.0

*Released 2023-07-16*

**Features**:

- `garden` now supports a `grafts` feature that allows you to
[stitch configuration entities from separate garden files](https://garden-rs.gitlab.io/configuration.html#grafts)
into a graft-specific namespace. Trees and variables from grafted configurations can be
referenced using `graft::` namespace qualifiers.

- `garden grow` can now configure [upstream branches](https://garden-rs.gitlab.io/commands.html#upstream-branches).

- `garden grow` can now configure [gitconfig settings with multiple values](https://garden-rs.gitlab.io/commands.html#upstream-branches#git-configuration-values)
using [`git config --add <name> <value>`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt---add).

## v0.7.0

*Released 2023-02-12*

**Features**:

- Trees, Groups, Gardens and Commands defined in the top-level `garden.yaml` can now
override entries defined via `garden.includes`. Configuration entities now follow
"last one wins" semantics -- if the same entity is defined in multiple includes files
then only the final definition will be used.
([#14](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/issues/14))
([#15](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/15))

- [Trees now sparsely override existing entries](https://garden-rs.gitlab.io/configuration.html#l#the-last-one-wins-rule).
This behavior allows a tree definition to replace just the `url` field, or to replace
individual tree commands while retaining the rest. Use `replace: true` in a Tree
definition in order to completely replace the existing entry instead of sparsely
overriding it.

- Improved shell completions for `garden`, `garden init` and `garden plant`.

**Packaging**:

- [0323pin](https://github.com/0323) packaged `garden` for pkgsrc/NetBSD and
[merged the package into the main branch!](http://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-changes/2023/01/22/msg267560.html)
([#13](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/issues/13))

## v0.6.0

*Released 2023-01-20*

**Features**:

- Both names and values in `gitconfig` can now use `${var}` expressions.
Previously only values were evaluated. Names are evaluated now as well.

**Fixes**:

- The `zsh` workaround for `garden completion zsh` is no longer needed.
The [documentation for generating zsh completions](https://garden-rs.gitlab.io/commands.html#zsh)
has been updated.
([#10](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/issues/10))

## v0.5.1

*Released 2023-01-15*

**Fixes**:

- Exec expressions were previously run with the current directory set to the
directory from which garden was run. Exec expressions are now run in the
tree's current directory.

## v0.5.0

*Released 2023-01-12*

**Features**:

- [Garden configuration files can now include other configuration files
](https://garden-rs.gitlab.io/configuration.html#includes) by specifying
the additional files to include in the `garden.includes` field.
The `includes` feature makes it possible to create modular and reusable garden files.
The `trees`, `variables`, `commands`, `groups` and `gardens` defined in the included
files are added to the current configuration.
([#7](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/7))

- [Garden commands can now use shell variables](https://garden-rs.gitlab.io/commands.html#shell-syntax)
using the standard (brace-less) shell `$variable` syntax. The braced `${garden}`
variable syntax remains reserved for resolving Garden Variables.
Double-`$` braces (ex: `$${...}`) can be used to escape a `$${variable}` from
evaluation so that a literal `${variable}` value is used in the garden command.
([#11](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/issues/11))
([#12](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/12))

- A new `garden completion` subcommand was added for providing shell command-line
completion using the [clap_complete](https://crates.io/crates/clap_complete) crate.
([#9](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/9))

- `garden -V | --version` was added alongside the `clap` rewrite for displaying
the `garden` command version.

**Development**:

- The `Makefile` has been replaced by a `garden.yaml` Garden file.
We can now use `garden {build, test, check, fmt, clippy, ...}` instead of `make ...`.
See [garden.yaml @ 5ef8d0ab16 for more details](https://gitlab.com/garden-rs/garden/-/raw/5ef8d0ab16a64660fef2bfc551e69cc782dfd4a3/garden.yaml).
Packagers can use `cargo install` to install `garden` and invoke `mdbook` directly
to install the user manual. We also provide
`garden -D DESTDIR=/tmp/stage -D prefix=/usr/local install-doc` if distros
want to install the user manual using our recipe.
([#8](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/pull/8))

- Garden's command-line parsing has been rewritten to leverage the
[clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap) crate and ecosystem.

## v0.4.1

*Released 2022-12-26*

**Features**:

- The `garden cmd --no-errexit` option was extended to work with commands that are
configured using a YAML list of strings. Commands that are specified using lists
are now indistinguishable from commands specified using multi-line strings.

## v0.4.0

*Released 2022-12-23*

**Breaking Changes**:

- `garden cmd` now runs custom commands using `<shell> -e -c '<command>'` by default.
The use of `-e` is a change in behavior and causes multi-line / multi-statement
commands to halt execution when the first non-zero exit code is encountered.
Use `set +e` at the top of of a multi-line command to opt-out of this behavior
on a per-command basis, or specify the `-n | --no-errexit` option.

- `garden` will now fallback to `bash` (and `sh`) as the default `garden.shell` value
when `zsh` (and `bash`) are not installed. As before, the `garden.shell`
configuration variable can be used to override the default shell.

**Features**:

- `garden prune` was added for removing orphaned Git repositories.
([#4](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden/issues/4))

- `garden cmd` can now run commands in breadth-first order when the
`-b/--breadth-first` option is used. Depth-first tree traversal is the default.
The `garden cmd --breadth-first` traversal runs all commands on a tree before
continuing on to the next tree. The default `garden cmd` depth-first traversal
runs a command across all trees before continuing on to the next command.
